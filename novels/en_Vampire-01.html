              February 1, XXXX (00:12) -15.1℃
              <br><br>
              On the night of February 1st, the lights of the small town danced under the reflection of the white snow. Although spring has arrived, the chill of winter has not completely dissipated. Some townspeople wore thick bearskin coats and hurried along the road with clenched fists, trying to get back to their warm homes. On this peaceful night, a loud thunderous noise suddenly resounded throughout the world, followed by a bright light that broke the tranquility of this small town with a population of less than 1,000 people. After the bang, almost all the houses in the town turned on the lights, and many people poked their heads out of the windows to find out what happened; some people rushed out of their homes, thinking that there was an explosion. However, there was no movement after the loud noise, and this incident quickly faded away from the busy lives of the residents of Esabaskah...
              <br><br>
              At the source of the loud noise, a girl with long hair lay unconscious on the ground. After a long time, she opened her eyes. The girl immediately sat up, covering her chest with her hands and gasping for air, as if her heart had been seriously injured in the last second.
              <br><br>
              "I don't want to die! I don't want to die!" the girl yelled hoarsely, her voice was so full of fear that She wasn't even aware of the fact that she was still alive. She struggled on the ground and didn't wake until her fast-moving arms hit a tree.
              <br><br>
              After that, the girl stood up and looked around, and said to herself: "If I remember correctly, today should be 1862 Friday, May 23rd. That feeling was really terrible, am I being killed? What is this place?"
              <br><br>
              She looked around curiously. All around her except for the vast snow was only the sky full of stars. The girl quickly understood that she was no longer in Romania, at least not in her hometown of Bucharest, because it was impossible to snow in Bucharest in May. She quickly took out a broken mirror and hurriedly put the pieces back together. After the pieces were almost put together, the aluminum-plated mirror reflected the girl's face in the faint moonlight. She could see her sharp fangs and her somewhat pale skin. She looked about 16 years old.
              <br><br>
              The girl then looked at her breasts in the mirror and saw that her dress had a hole in the middle of her chest. She touched her back and saw that there was also a small hole, but her body was intact. She herself was curious and doubtful about this strange phenomenon, but her breathing proved that she was still alive, and there was no doubt about it.
              <br><br>
              The girl carefully put the fragments of the mirror into a pocket, then turned the mirror over and touched the words engraved on it with her hand: "Andreea Lăcrămioara Ionescu" and "1823 - Transylvania". The girl bought this mirror 40 years ago when she was traveling in Transylvania. The mirror body is made of solid larch wood and is very durable.
              <br><br>
              "Don't I, as a vampire, have the damn right to live, just peacefully? Fuck!" yelled Andreea angrily and hopelessly. Remembering what happened to her during her lifetime, she punched on the tree. The tree snapped apart, and the clear sound echoed across the plain, and finally disappeared in the vast snowy night. Now, Andreea is looking for some caves or burrows in the snowfield where she can take shelter in the morning, because vampires cannot be exposed to sunlight.
              <br><br>
              不知道走了多久，安德烈雅開始感到飢餓，這時她正走在森林之間，沿着結冰的河流走。突然，一股殺意襲來，安德烈雅一驚連忙往後退了一步。說時遲，那時快，兩支箭刷地一聲在她面前擦過，又消失在厚厚的積雪中。緊接著，兩個男人從叢中跳出，手中拿著匕首指著安德烈雅，大喊：「<ruby>搶劫！把你所有值錢的東西都留下來！<rt>E itomi'ah! Te devahanı la-vatıkk!</rt></ruby>」
              <br><br>
              「<ruby>…啊？<rt>…Ce?</rt></ruby>」安德烈雅聽不懂他們的語言，只好疑惑地嘗試溝通：「<ruby>你好？<rt>Buna ziua?</rt></ruby><ruby>請問這裡是哪？<rt>Ce este locul asta?</rt></ruby><ruby>今夕是何夕？<rt>Ce an este?</rt></ruby>」
              <br><br>
              那兩個山賊在安德烈雅說話的時候看到了她的獠牙，頓時雙腳一軟跪在地上。安德烈雅從他們的眼睛中看出恐懼，很快就明白了原因，就摀住自己的嘴巴，打算解釋。但是，山賊早就夾著尾巴逃跑了。
              <br><br>
              安德烈雅沿著河流一路走，直到找到了一個山丘旁的山洞。她張開手掌，一個火球就在她的手心處出現，她把火球丟進山洞内，確定裏面安全且沒有威脅之後才躲進去。這個山洞雖然不大，但是入口處有一個拐彎，可以阻擋早上的陽光。加上這個山洞處於森林深處，一般不會有人類來到這裏，所以對於一隻剛轉生來到這個世界的吸血鬼來說實在是再好不過了。
              <br><br>
              「<ruby>第一件事——確保食物來源！<rt>Primul lucru este să asigurați mâncarea!</rt></ruby>」安德烈雅記住了這個臨時藏身處的位置之後，就外出尋找食物。她的運氣不差，在一處草叢看見了一雙露出來的兔子耳朵。安德烈雅扒開草叢，發現了一窩死掉的雪兔。她被眼前的場景驚呆了，連忙檢查兔子的屍體。
              <br><br>
              「<ruby>這些屍體是暖的…看來才死了沒多久…<rt>Corpurile erau calde...păreau că nu erau moarte de foarte mult timp.</rt></ruby>」她摸摸屍體，不禁為這些可憐的小毛球感到痛心，她在胸前畫十字，然後把這些野兔帶回藏身處，用魔法生火烤熟，「<ruby>上帝啊，求您憐憫。<rt>Doamne, miluiește-mă.</rt></ruby>」
              <br><br>
              …
              <br><br>
              吃過肉後，安德烈雅的身子暖了不少，她摘了一堆乾草鋪了一個簡陋的床，就躺著上面睡着了……
