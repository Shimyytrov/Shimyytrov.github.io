        <h2>Fact #3</h2>
        <p>At first, the name of our team<br>was "Levi Yamiyoshin Music Channel".<br>(Because LYMC was came from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbOBfB7ODrJKOMoT8M9fDxw">LYGC</a>).<br>More in Fact #4</p>
        <h2>Fact #4</h2>
        <p>The reason that we( I ) change the<br>name was because I created a virtual<br>country named <a href="https://discord.gg/P25pDM4mkr">"Shimyytrov Democratic Federal Empire"</a><br>(At first it was Darkness Empire). I'll<br>release some tracks related to SDFE.</p>
